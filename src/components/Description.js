        <p>
          The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by
          Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break down work into
          intervals, traditionally 25 minutes, separated by short breaks of five
          minutes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, named after a
          tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a student.
