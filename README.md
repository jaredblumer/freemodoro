Improve Your Focus and Boost Your Productivity With This [Free and Open Source Pomodoro Timer](https://freemodoro-cbc150480d4a.herokuapp.com/)

## What is a Pomodoro Timer?
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes, separated by short breaks of five minutes. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, named after a tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a student. Research has shown that our brains aren't built to focus for hours at a time, and the most effective method to refresh attention spans is to take a break.

## How long should each Pomodoro and break last?
The traditional Pomodoro Technique recommends 25 minutes of work followed by a five minute break. After completing four work periods, you take a longer break of 15 to 30 minutes.

A recent study conducted by the Draugiem Group found that the most productive employees were those whose work-to-break ratio was 52 minutes of work, followed by 17 minutes of rest. If 25:5 Pomodoros don't work best for you, give a 52:17 a shot. You can change your round and break settings using the Settings button above.
